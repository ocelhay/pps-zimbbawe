Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a significant global health problem. Resistance occurs when bacteria, parasites, viruses or fungi are exposed to antimicrobials but not killed by them. Resistance is a natural phenomenon which gives organisms the opportunity to adapt and change, rendering medicines ineffective (2). Existing resistance patterns are spreading and new resistance patterns are emerging around the world (2). Growing resistance is of extreme concern for public health because resistant organisms lead to longer illnesses, increased costs of treatment and increased mortality (2,3).

Patients with infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria are generally at increased risk of worse clinical outcomes and death, and consume more healthcare resources than patients infected with the same bacteria that are not resistant. In addition to its direct impact on population health, AMR is associated with significant economic costs. When infections are resistant to first-line drugs more expensive therapies must be used, often requiring longer duration of treatment and hospitalized care, which increases healthcare costs and contributes to the economic burden of disease (3).
